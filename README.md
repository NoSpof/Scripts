# Scripts

This repository gathers all the Bash / shell scripts that have not yet been migrated to a golang development.

They were mostly set up for OneShot automation needs and have not yet been refactored.

This repository is open to contributions. It is in no way a script to set up solutions that can be used in production.

ATTENTION, If you wish to use these scripts I could not be held responsible for the consequences of using them. Remember to check that the script has the desired behavior before deploying / modifying it on a large scale.

If you encounter a bug and want to share your experiences, do not hesitate to create an issue with your contributions
